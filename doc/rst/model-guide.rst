Modeling Guide for MP-based AMPL Solvers
=========================================


Ever wondered how to model logical and non-linear constraints? For example:

- At most one of the variables *x*, *y* can be positive

- All variables in a group should have different values

- *y = sin(x)*.

A series of small modeling tasks like these are handled in the
:ref:`MP Modeling Series <mp-modeling-series>`,
while below follows a comprehensive guide.
