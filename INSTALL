This file describes how to build and install AMPL Solver Library (ASL),
function libraries and solver drivers.

In the following instructions ${AMPL_DIR} denotes a local copy of the
AMPL repository, which is simply a directory on your computer with ASL
source code, example models, etc. The repository can be obtained from
https://github.com/ampl/ampl/ or using Git:

  git clone --recursive git://github.com/ampl/ampl.git

Requirements
------------

* To build the amplgsl library you should have the source code for GSL with
  CMake build support in ${AMPL_DIR}/solvers/amplgsl/gsl. This version of
  GSL is avaialble for download from https://github.com/ampl/gsl.
  You can retrieve ASL and GSL sources at the same time using the command

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/ampl/ampl.git

* To build gecode, the AMPL driver for Gecode constraint programming solver,
  you should have Gecode source code in ${AMPL_DIR}/solvers/gecode/lib.
  You can retrieve ASL and Gecode sources at the same time using the command

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/ampl/ampl.git

* To build ilogcp, the AMPL driver for IBM ILOG Constraint Programming
  (CP) Optimizer, you should have IBM ILOG CP Optimizer, CPLEX and Concert
  installed. Normally these are installed as parts of IBM ILOG CPLEX
  Optimization Studio. The code has been tested with Optimization Studio
  version 12.4.

Build using CMake
-----------------

An included CMake build script (CMakeLists.txt) can be used to build
AMPL Solver Library on a wide range of platforms. You can download
CMake for free from http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html.

CMake works by generating native makefiles or build projects that can
be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The typical
workflow starts with:

  mkdir mybuild      # Create a directory to hold the build output.
  cd mybuild
  cmake ${AMPL_DIR}  # Generate native build scripts.

If you are on a *nix system, you should now see a Makefile in the
current directory. Now you can build ASL by running "make".

Once ASL has been built you can invoke "make test" to run the tests.

If you use Windows and have Vistual Studio installed, an AMPL.sln file
and several .vcproj files will be created. You can then build them
using Visual Studio.

On Mac OS X with Xcode installed, a .xcodeproj file will be generated.

Build without CMake
-------------------

Alternatively you can build AMPL Solver Library with make using the
provided makefiles. In this case you might need to edit the makefiles
to specify the paths to CPLEX Optimization Studio and GSL.

First build ASL:

  cd ${AMPL_DIR}/solvers
  ./configurehere
  make

Then run "make -f makefile.u" in the subdirectories of solver drivers
you want to build.

On Windows the AMPL solver library should be built with the shared (DLL)
runtime using the command "nmake RUNTIME=-MD -f makefile.vc". This is
necessary to avoid linkage errors with IBM ILOG CP Optimizer which doesn't
provide libraries linked with static runtime.

Using Eclipse CDT
-----------------

You can generate Eclipse CDT project files with CMake:

  cmake -G "Eclipse CDT 4 -  Unix Makefiles"

To get rid of semantic errors reported by Indexer add preprocessor symbols
"_GLIBCPP_USE_NAMESPACES", "__GXX_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX0X__" and "STAND_ALONE"
in "Project Properties" / "C/C++ Include Files and Symbols" and rebuild
the index.

Using Windows SDK
-----------------

If you want to build ASL with the Windows SDK toolchain, use a helper
script cmake/run-cmake.bat instead of running CMake directly. This script
configures build environment and runs CMake forwarding all command-line
arguments to it, for example:

  cmake\run-cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" .
