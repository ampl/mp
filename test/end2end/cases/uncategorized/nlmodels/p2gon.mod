# Maximum area for unit-diameter polygon (Prieto's second model).

# This derives from a GAMS model by Francisco J. Prieto -- the second
# one in E-mail that he sent to Margaret Wright.  Prieto described
# this as "a very particular solution for the problem, taking advantage
# of [a] certain property that I [Prieto] am convinced (although I cannot
# prove it) that the solution must have.  The formulation
# is much more efficient, and you can go up to sizes of around 70-80.

# "Symmetry is assumed (so the size is reduced to a half), and also as
# many constraints as possible are set up as equalities.

# "The results obtained seem to coincide (within some error margin) with
# the ones obtained from the previous program."
