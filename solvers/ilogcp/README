The solver "ilogcp" uses IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer to solve constraint
programming problems and the solver "ilocplex" uses CPLEX to solve
integer, mixed-integer, linear programming, and quadratic problems,
possibly involving integer variables.  Both CP Optimizer and CPLEX
are used through the Concert API. Normally the ilogcp or ilocplex
solver is invoked by AMPL's solve command, which gives the invocations

     ilogcp stub -AMPL
     ilocplex stub -AMPL

in which stub.nl is an AMPL generic output file (possibly written
by "ampl -obstub" or "ampl -ogstub").  After solving the problem,
the solver writes a stub.sol file for use by ampl's solve and solution
commands.  When you run ampl, this all happens automatically if you
give the AMPL commands

     option solver ilogcp;
     solve;

for ilogcp or

     option solver ilocplex;
     solve;

for ilocplex.

You can control the solvers by setting the environment variable
ilogcp_options for ilogcp or ilocplex_options for ilocplex appropriately
(either by using ampl's option command, or by using the shell's set and
export commands before you invoke ampl).  You can put one or more
(white-space separated) phrases in $ilogcp_options.  A few of the phrases
are single words:

     Phrase       Meaning

     version      Report version details before solving the problem.

Others are name-value pairs, possibly separated by '=', as in

     timelimit 600
or
     timelimit=600
or
     timelimit = 600

any of which limits CP Optimizer search time to 600 seconds.  Options such
as logverbosity, that take enumerated list of values, accept both numeric
and string values, so

     logverbosity=terse

is equivalent to

     logverbosity=1

In particular, switches that take values 0 or 1 also accept values
"off" or "on".

The following commands prints the full list of options with descriptions:

     ilogcp -=
     ilogplex -=

solve_result_num values
=======================

Here is a table of solve_result_num values that "ilogcp" or "ilocplex" can
return to an AMPL session, along with the text that appears in the associated
solve_message.

        Value   Message

          0     optimal solution
        100     feasible solution
        200     infeasible problem
        201     infeasible or unbounded problem
        300     unbounded problem
        500     error
        600     interrupted

-------------------

If you invoke "ilogcp stub -AMPL" or "ilogcp stub", you can also
supply additional command-line arguments of the form name=value.
Such arguments override specifications in $ilogcp_options.  Example:

     ampl -obfoo foo.model foo.data
     nohup ilogcp -s foo timing=1 2>>times&

to solve a problem whose solution will take a while; after it finishes,

     ampl foo.model foo.data -
     solution foo.sol;
     display ... /* things involving the computed solution */;

(Here, - denotes standard input, and ampl reads the "solution..."
and "display..." lines.)
