<h1>
Constraint Logic Programming Extensions Recognized by the Concert Driver
</h1>

        For combinatorial or discrete optimization, AMPL currently
provides the option of including integer-valued variables in algebraic
objectives and constraints.  This is sufficient to make good use of
integer programming solvers that use a classical branch-and-bound
procedure.<p>

        Optimization systems for <i>constraint logic programming</i>
also use a branching or tree search, but are able to work with a much
broader variety of combinatorial expressions.  In exchange for this
advantage, logic programming solvers typically forego the ability to
generate the bounds and cuts that are used to great advantage to limit
the search in integer programming.  The logic programming approach
thus tends to be advantageous for problems that are "highly"
combinatorial, in the sense that their formulation in terms of integer
variables is artificial and hard to work with, or requires a very
large number of variables or constraints, or fails to yield strong
bounds.</p><p>

        AMPL has been extended in a variety of ways to take better
advantage of the strengths of constraint logic programming solvers.
Several kinds of constraints useful in logic programming are naturally
expressed by allowing variables in certain operands or arguments where
only constant expressions are normally permitted.  The following
operators have been added to the AMPL language, or extended to accept
constraint expressions as operands, in order to facilitate writing
constraint logical programming models:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><i><a href="#logop">Logical operators</a>:</i></b> <tt>and</tt>,
<tt>or</tt>, <tt>not</tt>; iterated <tt>exists</tt>, <tt>forall</tt>

</li><li><b><i><a href="#pairop">Pairwise operators</a>:</i></b>
<tt>alldiff</tt></li>
</ul>

In this document we give the syntax and usage summary of the extended
operators that are recognized in the AMPL Concert driver.
This driver provides connection to IBM ILOG
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimizer/">
CPLEX</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-cp-optimizer/">
CPLEX CP Optimizer</a> through
the Concert C++ interface. Each set of extensions corresponds to a section
below. The final section summarizes correspondence between AMPL and Concert
constructs.

<h2>
<a name="logop">Logical operators</a>
</h2>
        Basic AMPL constraints consist of numerical-valued
expressions connected by <tt>&lt;=</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt> or <tt>=</tt>.
These constraint expressions are now allowed to be connected by AMPL's
unary and binary logical operators,

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><i>constraint-expr1</i><tt> or </tt><i>constraint-expr2</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff at least one of the operands is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd><dt><i>constraint-expr1</i><tt> and </tt><i>constraint-expr2</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff both of the operands are satisfied.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>not </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the operand is not satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

and AMPL's iterated forms of the binary logical operators:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>exists {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>} </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the operand is satisfied for at least one member
of the indexing set (the iterated form of <tt>or</tt>).<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>forall {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>} </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the operand is satisfied for all members
of the indexing set (the iterated form of <tt>and</tt>).<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Constraint expressions can also be grouped by by parentheses:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>(</tt> <i>constraint-expr</i> <tt>)</tt><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

So an AMPL constraint can be any logical combination of equalities
and inequalities.<p>

        The simplest useful application of this extension is to
specify disjunctive constraints.  For example, in
<a href="http://www.ampl.com/BOOK/EXAMPLES/EXAMPLES2/multmip3.mod">
multmip3.mod</a> from the AMPL book, we require for every origin
<tt>i</tt> and destination <tt>j</tt> that total shipments
<tt>sum</tt> <tt>{p</tt> <tt>in</tt> <tt>PROD}</tt>
<tt>Trans[i,j,p]</tt> lie either at zero or between <tt>minload</tt>
and <tt>limit[i,j]</tt>.  This is accomplished in an integer
programming framework by introducing auxiliary binary variables
<tt>Use[i,j]</tt>,</p><p>
</p><pre>   var Trans {ORIG,DEST,PROD} &gt;= 0;
   var Use {ORIG,DEST} binary;
</pre>
and forming the following constraints:
<pre>   subject to Multi {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &lt;= limit[i,j] * Use[i,j];

   subject to Min_Ship {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt;= minload * Use[i,j];
</pre>
The same restrictions can be stated using the <tt>or</tt> operator
in this way:
<pre>   subject to Multi_Min_Ship {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] = 0 <b>or</b>
      minload &lt;= sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &lt;= limit[i,j];
</pre>
Fewer variables and constraints are required, and the statement of
the constraint is much closer to its original formulation.<p>

        In another example, variables <tt>Assign[i1,i2,j]</tt> have
been defined to represent the number of people of type
<tt>(i1,i2)</tt> assigned to location <tt>j</tt>.  The following
declarations define an additional restriction in integer programming
terms:</p><p>
</p><pre>   param upperbnd {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST} :=
      min (ceil((number2[i1,i2]/card {PEOPLE}) * hiDine[j]) + give[i1,i2],
           hiTargetTitle[i1,j] + giveTitle[i1],
           hiTargetLoc[i2,j] + giveLoc[i2],
           number2[i1,i2]);

   var Lone {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST} binary;

   subj to Isolation1 {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] &lt;= upperbnd[i1,i2,j] * Lone[i1,i2,j];

   subj to Isolation2a {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] +
         sum {ii1 in ADJACENT[i1]: (ii1,i2) in TYPE2} Assign2[ii1,i2,j]
            &gt;= 2 * Lone[i1,i2,j];

   subj to Isolation2b {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] &gt;= Lone[i1,i2,j];
</pre>
Using the <tt>or</tt> operator, the same thing can be said much more
directly and concisely:
<pre>   subj to Isolation {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] = 0 <b>or</b>
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] +
         sum {ii1 in ADJACENT[i1]: 
                       (ii1,i2) in TYPE2} Assign2[ii1,i2,j] &gt;= 2;
</pre>
As a further complication under the integer programming approach,
there are many other ways that this either-or constraint can be
transformed, through addition of binary variables, to inequalities
suitable for integer programming.  Other transformations differ in the
computation of the upper bound parameter, in the details of the
constraint expressions, and in the choice of "cuts" such as
<tt>Isolation2b</tt> to tighten the formulation.  The transformation
exhibited above is not obviously superior to others, though it did
prove to be superior -- for the data of interest -- in a series of
empirical tests.

<p>
    Note that it is possible to specify a feasible region that isn't
    closed by using the <tt>not</tt> operator.  As a result, optimization
    problems using continuous variables may be meaningless.  This is
    illustrated by a very simple problem:
<pre>        var x;
        minimize Obj: x;
        subject to OpenCons: not (x &lt;= 2);
</pre>
    The objective has an infimum of 2, but no minimum that
    satisfies the constraint.  (The same problem arises if we
    use strict inequality, that is &lt; and &gt;, constraint expressions.)</p>

<p>
    The above problem doesn't occur in CP Optimizer because
    it only allows discrete variables. To avoid this problem CPLEX restricts
    use of strict inequalities to integer expressions.
</p>

<p>AMPL's logical constraint expressions involving <tt>and</tt> and
<tt>not</tt> are converted into corresponding Concert C++ expressions
that use overloaded operators <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> and <tt>!</tt>.
The AMPL expression <tt>c1 or c2</tt> where <tt>c1</tt> and <tt>c2</tt>
are constraint expression is translated into <tt>IloIfThen(env, !cc1, cc2)</tt>
where <tt>cc1</tt> and <tt>cc2</tt> are Concert counterparts of
<tt>c1</tt> and <tt>c2</tt>. The reason logical OR is not translated into
a Concert expression using overloaded <tt>||</tt> operator is that
<tt>IloIfThen</tt> accepts more types of constraints on the right-hand
side. Iterated logical operators <tt>exists</tt> and <tt>forall</tt> are
implemented using <tt>IloOr</tt> and <tt>IloAnd</tt> respectively.</p>

<p>CPLEX deals with logical operators with the help of indicator constraints.
An indicator constraint is a way to control with a binary variable whether
or not a given linear constraint takes effect. Big-M formulations
provide a conventional alternative to indicator constraints. However these
formulations can be numerically unstable. CPLEX automatically uses indicator
constraints when it encounters a constraint within an expression and when it
encounters expressions which can be linearized.</p>

<h2>
<a name="condop">Conditional operators</a>
</h2>
        AMPL already provides an <tt>if-then-else</tt> operator that
returns a value that can be used in expressions:<p>

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>
      then </tt><i>object-expr1</i>
</dt><dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>
      then </tt><i>object-expr1</i><tt> 
      else </tt><i>object-expr2</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Takes the value of <i>object-expr1</i> when the
<i>logical-expr</i> is true, and the value of <i>object-expr2</i> (or
0 if omitted) when the <i>logical-expr</i> is false.  Each
<i>object-expr</i> may be any expression that evaluates to a legal set
member -- that is, either a number or a string.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>
      then </tt><i>set-expr1</i><tt>
      else </tt><i>set-expr2</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Takes the value of <i>set-expr1</i> when the <i>logical-expr</i>
is true, and the value of <i>set-expr2</i> when the
<i>logical-expr</i> is false.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

When this operator appears in a constraint, the <i>logical-expr</i>
can contain variables, in which case AMPL handles the constraint like
other nonlinear constraints, passing an expression tree to the solver.
In particular, the <i>logical-expr</i> may be any valid
<i>constraint-expr</i>.<p>

AMPL also has a similar <tt>if-then</tt> form of indexing expression,
which is used in the context of constraints as follows:

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>subject to </tt><i>name</i><tt> {if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>}:
      </tt><i>constraint-expr</i><tt>;</tt><p>

</p></dt><dd>Enforces the constraint specified by the <i>constraint-expr</i> 
if and only if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Thus for example in section 8.4 of the book we have:
<pre>   subject to Time {if avail &gt; 0}:
      sum {p in PROD} (1/rate[p]) * Make[p] &lt;= avail;
</pre>
It is arguably more natural, however, to make the <tt>if</tt> condition
part of the constraint expression:
<pre>   subject to Time:
      if avail &gt;  0 then
         sum {p in PROD} (1/rate[p]) * Make[p] &lt;= avail;
</pre>
Other forms of conditional constraints for logic programming are as follows:
<dl><blockquote>

<dt><i>logical-expr</i><tt> ==&gt;
      </tt><i>constraint-expr1</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true and
<i>constraint-expr1</i> is satisfied, or if the <i>logical-expr</i> is
false.<p>

</p></dd><dt><i>logical-expr</i><tt> ==&gt;
      </tt><i>constraint-expr1</i><tt> else
      </tt><i>constraint-expr2</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true and
<i>constraint-expr1</i> is satisfied, or if the <i>logical-expr</i> is
false and <i>constraint-expr2</i> is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd><dt><i>logical-expr</i><tt> &lt;==&gt;
      </tt><i>constraint-expr</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true and
<i>constraint-expr</i> is satisfied, or if the <i>logical-expr</i> is
false and <i>constraint-expr</i> is not satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

By allowing variables on both sides of <tt>==></tt> and <tt><==></tt>,
these forms considerably expand the variety of conditional constraints
that AMPL can conveniently express.  For example, the previously defined
<tt>Multi_Min_Ship</tt> constraint can be written:
<pre>   subject to Multi_Min_Ship {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt; 0 ==>
         minload &lt;= sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &lt;= limit[i,j];
</pre>
Again, the <i>logical-expr</i> can be any <i>constraint-expr</i>.
<p>

The <tt>if-then</tt> constraints like <tt>Time</tt> and
<tt>Multi_Min_Ship</tt> above and <tt>==&gt;</tt> constraints are
converted into the Concert representation using <tt>IloIfThen</tt>.
For <tt>if-then-else</tt> and <tt>==&gt; else</tt> constraints, a pair
of <tt>IloIfThen</tt> objects is generated. The <tt>&lt;==&gt;</tt>
constraint is translated into corresponding Concert C++ expression that
uses the overloaded operator <tt>==</tt>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="cardop">Counting operators</a>
</h2>
        AMPL's <tt>count</tt> operator returns the
number of times that a certain constraint is satisfied:
<p>

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>count {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>The number of members of the <i>indexing</i> set such that the 
<i>constraint-expr</i> is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

As an example, consider the <tt>multmip3.mod</tt> model previously cited.
It has the following constraint on the number of destinations served by any
origin:
<pre>   subject to Max_Serve {i in ORIG}:
      sum {j in DEST} Use[i,j] &lt;= maxserve;
</pre>
Using <tt>count</tt>, the same thing can be expressed in terms of
the natural <tt>Trans[i,j,p]</tt> variables, without recourse to the
auxiliary zero-one <tt>Use[i,j]</tt> variables:
<pre>   subject to Max_Serve {i in ORIG}:
      count {j in DEST} (sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt;  0) &lt;= maxserve;
</pre>
The <i>constraint-expr</i> can be any valid AMPL constraint.  The
AMPL translator will instantiate it for each member of the
<i>indexing</i> set, and will communicate all of the instantiated
constraints to the solver using the conventions already in place.<p>

Additional iterated logical operators are defined to simplify 
the descriptions of constraints in some common special cases:

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>atmost </tt><i>k</i><tt> {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for at most
<i>k</i> members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>atleast </tt><i>k</i><tt> {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for at least
<i>k</i> members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>exactly </tt><i>k</i><tt> {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for exactly
<i>k</i> members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

<i>k</i> can be any constant arithmetic expression that evaluates to a
nonnegative integer value.<p>

Another particularly important special case occurs when counting the
number of set members at which a given expression takes a particular
value.  As a simple example, consider the scheduling problem that
assigns a number of jobs to a smaller number of machines, so that at
most <tt>cap[k]</tt> jobs are assigned to machine <tt>k</tt>.  The
conventional formulation defines a binary (zero-one) variable
<tt>Assign[j,k]</tt> for each job-machine pair, such that
<tt>Assign[j,k]</tt> will be 1 if and only if job <tt>j</tt> is
assigned to machine <tt>k</tt> (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/sched1.mod"><tt>sched1.mod</tt></a>):
</p><pre>   param n integer &gt;  0;

   set JOBS := 1..n;
   set MACHINES := 1..n;

   param cap {MACHINES} integer &gt;= 0;

   var Assign {JOBS,MACHINES} binary;
</pre>
The requirements of the assignment can then be specified by one
algebraic constraint for each job and for each machine:<p>
</p><pre>   subj to OneMachinePerJob {j in JOBS}:
      sum {k in MACHINES} Assign[j,k] = 1;

   subj to CapacityOfMachine {k in MACHINES}:
      sum {j in JOBS} Assign[j,k] &lt;= cap[k];
</pre>
As an alternative, we could associate with each job only one variable,
whose value is taken from the set of machines:
<pre>   var MachineForJob {JOBS} integer &gt;= 1, &lt;= n;
</pre>
For each <tt>j</tt> in <tt>JOBS</tt>, the value of
<tt>MachineForJob[j]</tt> would be the number of the machine that is
assigned to do job <tt>j</tt>.  This approach requires fewer variables
by an order of magnitude, and automatically enforces the requirement
that one machine be assigned to each job.  To specify that at most
<tt>cap[k]</tt> jobs are assigned to machine <tt>k</tt>, we could use
the <tt>count</tt> operator (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/sched2.mod"><tt>sched2.mod</tt></a>):
<pre>   subj to CapacityOfMachine {k in MACHINES}:
      count {j in JOBS} (MachineForJob[j] = k) &lt;= cap[k];
</pre>
This is not as readable a statement of the constraint as one might
like, however, and it is likely to be inefficient.  Because the
<tt>count</tt> operator can be applied to any AMPL
<i>constraint-expr</i>, its implementation in the AMPL translator
would scan through the entire set <tt>JOBS</tt> for each constraint,
testing <tt>MachineForJob[j] = k</tt> for every
combination of job <tt>j</tt> and machine <tt>k</tt> -- even though
only one pass through the jobs is necessary to accumulate the counts
for all machines.  To address this AMPL offers a more specialized
iterated operator for counting individual values assumed by an indexed
expression <!--(<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/sched3.mod"><tt>sched3.mod</tt></a>)-->:<p>
</p><pre>   subj to CapacityOfMachine {k in MACHINES}:
      numberof k in ({j in JOBS} MachineForJob[j]) &lt;= cap[k];
</pre>
The general form is:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>numberof </tt><i>k</i><tt> in ({</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>object-expr</i><tt>)</tt> <p>

</p></dt><dd>The number of members of the <i>indexing</i> set such that the 
<i>object-expr</i> is equal to <i>k</i>.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Although it would still be possible to implement this operator
inefficiently, the presence of <tt>countof</tt> could alert the
AMPL translator to the possibility of a more efficient evaluation.<p>

In the Concert driver, the <tt>count</tt> operator is translated
into a sum of constraint expressions that represent its arguments.
This approach uses the fact that a constraint expression in Concert
is evaluated to 1 if satisfied and 0 otherwise and the <tt>+</tt>
operator has suitable overload.
The <tt>atmost</tt> (<tt>atleast</tt>, <tt>exactly</tt>) <i>k</i>
operators are converted into the sum of constraint subexpressions
<tt>&lt;= </tt> (<tt>&gt;=</tt>, <tt>==</tt>) <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>If the option <tt>usenumberof</tt> is set to 1 (the default), the
<tt>numberof</tt> operators that have constant <i>k</i> and the same
expression lists are represented as a single <tt>IloDistribute</tt>
constraint. Otherwise they are implemented as a sum of constraints of
the form <i>object-expr</i> <tt> == </tt> <i>k</i>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="pairop">Pairwise operators</a>
</h2>
        Various assignment and related combinatorial problems require
that a collection of entities be pairwise different or disjoint.  New
iterated operators for these conditions would make them easier to
state and would help to make the resulting problems easier to
solve.<p>

An example is given by the assignment problem that resembles the one
defined above, but with equal numbers of jobs and machines.  Each
job is assigned to one machine, as before, but also each machine gets
one job.  In describing the constraints on the machines, we can
dispense with the parameters <tt>cap[k]</tt> (which would all be 1)
and can instead simply say that no two variables
<tt>MachineForJob[j1]</tt> and <tt>MachineForJob[j2]</tt> have the
same value.  Such a restriction can be stated in AMPL as follows:
</p><pre>   subj to OneJobPerMachine {j1 in JOBS, j2 in JOBS: j1 &lt;  j2}:
      MachineForJob[j1] != MachineForJob[j2];
</pre>
This is a cumbersome way to express the simple idea of being pairwise
different, however, and it gives rise to an order of magnitude more
constraints than the conventional formulation (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/assign1.mod"><tt>assign1.mod</tt></a>).  We would prefer to
regard pairwise inequality as a property of the entire collection of
<tt>MachineForJob</tt> variables, rather than as a collection of
binary relations between individual variables.<p>

In AMPL, properties of indexed collections are defined by means of
iterated operators such as <tt>sum</tt> and <tt>exists</tt>.  An analogous
operator for pairwise difference in an indexed collection of variables has
been introduced
(<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/assign2.mod"><tt>assign2.mod</tt></a>):
</p><pre>   subj to OneJobPerMachine: alldiff {j in JOBS} MachineForJob[j];
</pre>
In general, this operator could be applied to any collection of 
expressions:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>alldiff {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>object-expr</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>object-expr</i> takes different values for
all pairs of different members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Using <tt>alldiff</tt> makes constraints easier to read, and also
conveys more useful information to a solver than a large collection of
individual inequalities.

<p>Concert provides classes that correspond closely to these
iterated pairwise operators.  Class <tt>IloAllDiff</tt> specifies
that the components of an array of integer variables (type
<tt>IloIntVarArray</tt>) must be pairwise different.  Solver's search
procedure handles these relationships directly in an efficient way.</p>
