Sun May 16 12:21:33 EDT 1993
  Add arg need_stub to getstub.c (==> changes to getstub.h, mng.c, nl2.c).
  Change %ld to %d in some format strings in lin1.c and lin2.c.
  New variant linrc.c of lin1.c that uses names from stub.row and stub.col
file if available.

Sun Jun 20 08:59:19 EDT 1993
  Many minor changes, plus new sample input and output files.
Postscript for "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL" is now available
as "93-10 from research/nam".

Wed Jun 30 23:46:08 EDT 1993
  Postscript for "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL" (available as
"93-10 from research/nam") updated to describe new ordering of
nonlinear variables and counts in .nl files that describe
nonlinear integer variables.

Thu Sep  2 07:52:54 EDT 1993
  nl2.c: fix bug in loop that checks for bounds on variables:
<	for(i = j = 0; i < N;  i++)
---
>	for(i = j = 0; i < P;  i++)

Thu Nov 18 08:39:21 EST 1993
  README: comments about ftp updated.

Wed Feb 22 10:20:23 EST 1995
  dualconv.c: add #ifdef KR_headers stuff for K&R C compilers.
  linrc.c: minor adjustment to permit compilation on non-Unix systems
(such as MS-DOS).

Mon Apr 21 22:45:29 EDT 1997
  Update for revised amplsolver.a and "Hooking Your Solver to AMPL".

Thu Aug 14 00:19:57 EDT 1997
  Update MATLAB interface files amplfunc.c and spamfunc.c for MATLAB
5.x, renaming the old MATLAB 4.x versions amplfun4.c and spamfun4.c.

Thu Mar 26 22:22:02 EST 1998
  Trivial tweaks to ve08.c (we know that nerror >= 0).
  amplfunc.c, spamfunc.c: new optional 7th left-hand (return) argument
to amplfunc('stub') and spamfunc('stub'): the cvar array: if positive,
cvar(i) is the subscript of the variable (in 1..length(x)) that
complements constraint i.
  evalg.m: minor correction: initialize j = 0.
  makefile: adjust to reflect funcadd1.c in the parent (solvers)
directory.

Fri Mar 27 15:49:25 EST 1998
  Adjust makefiles to reflect addition of funcadd1.o to ../amplsolver.a.

Wed Apr 15 14:33:56 EDT 1998
  Adjust amplfunc.c, enewt.m, rvmsg.c, savesol.m, spamfunc.c, tnmain.c,
and ve08.c to return solve_result to AMPL (by assigning solve_result_num);
minor tweak to solve message format by solvers "v8" and "ve08".

Tue Jul 14 15:52:34 EDT 1998
  linrc.c: compute clen and rlen (which matters if constraint or
variable names exceed 8 characters in length).
  Cosmetic change to amplfunc.c and spamfunc.c that eliminates a
pointless warning message by some compilers.

Wed Jul 29 09:32:15 EDT 1998
  README: add table of possible solve_result_num values for mng, mnh, nl2.

Fri Apr  9 00:46:03 EDT 1999
  dualconv.c: set asl->i.n_var0 and asl->i.n_con0, which became
necessary after changes for declared suffixes.

Thu Apr 15 16:25:02 EDT 1999
  makefile and various .out files: add 2>&1 to various test invocation
lines.  On Microsoft systems, amplsolv.lib merges stderr with stdout,
and this change makes the output files agree.

Fri Jun 25 18:32:51 EDT 1999
  dualconv.c: pass arithmetic code and flags; adjust solve_result_num
to interchange "infeasible" and "unbounded".
  linrc.c: formatting tweaks.
  makefile: omit dietlrc.out (old name for linrcdie.out).

Wed Sep 15 14:33:15 EDT 1999
  spamfunc.c: trivial tweak: omit two unused variables.

Thu Oct 14 00:34:11 EDT 1999
  New example nlcopy.c to illustrate new library routine fg_write().

Mon Jan 17 16:25:33 EST 2000
  qtest.c: fix botch:
75c75
< 		nz = n_var + n_con;
---
> 		nz = n_obj + n_con;

Thu Feb  3 22:25:26 EST 2000
  makefile.vc: adjusted reflecting changes to ../makefile.vc.

Sat Aug  5 11:19:33 EDT 2000
  nlcopy.c: omit an unused variable.
  ch3mnh.out, ch3mnh.sol: trivial update.
  evalg.m: change amplfunc(x, 2) to amplfunc(x, 1) to accord with
documentation.  (Both currently give the same result.)
  init.m: check for pname not assigned a character stub value.

Wed Sep  6 10:28:50 EDT 2000
  linrc.c, linrcdie.out: make values in the table of variable
bounds and cost coefficients agree with the column headings by
writing cost coefficients in column 2 rather than column 4.

Tue Sep 12 15:44:34 EDT 2000
  qtest.c: show lower and upper slack values for constraints.  Today's
changes to solvers/nqpcheck.c (subtraction of constant terms from
constraint bounds rather than incorporating constant terms into
constraint bodies) sometimes cause different values for constraint
bodies, but not for the lower and upper slacks.
  ch3.nl:  update to reflect changes to AMPL starting in version
20000128 that cause the first constraint of this example to be (which
involves only linear defined variables) to be rendered as an explicitly
linear constraint, and ordered as such.  Sample output files updated
accordingly.

Mon Jan 22 11:33:05 EST 2001
  amplfunc.c, spamfunc.c: adjust "Trouble evaluating..." error messages.
  makefile.u: "make test1" leave unexpected results in directory "bad1"
and "make test2" leave them in directory "bad".
  Various *.out files:  update to current output (under IRIX 6.5).

Sat Mar 16 00:07:05 EST 2002
  ve08.c: add ASL_find_default_no_groups to the flags in the pfg_read
call when compiled with PSEDREAD #defined by v8.c.  This was made
necessary by a change to the .nl readers on 20010607:  ve08.c is not
prepared to deal with group partially separable structure.
  makefile.u: change the FC assignment to f77 (to cope with some shells
for which "fc" has special magic meaning).

Tue Aug  9 22:58:01 MDT 2005
  New files README.gjh and gjh.c, and corresponding updates to makefile.u
and makefile.vc.  README.gjh describes "solver" gjh, whose source is gjh.c,
which computes gradients, Jacobian matrices and Hessian matrices and makes
their values available in an AMPL session (via an "include" command).

Tue Dec  2 20:37:41 MST 2008
  gjh.c: omit declaration of the unused w0 array.
  Add hist.c (a way to provide command-line history to interactive programs,
such as ampl).  Requires the GNU history and readline libraries.  For use with
ampl, invoke "hist ampl -vi2 ..." (where -vi2 causes prompts to appear).

Wed May 13 21:30:40 MDT 2009
  spamfunc.c: adjust to accord with a changed return type (mwIndex* rather
than int*) from functions mxGetIr and mxGetJc) in recent versions of Matlab.
(For older versions, use -DmwIndex=int when compiling spamfunc.c.)
  hist.c:  add author name to comments.

Sun Jul 12 23:08:18 MDT 2009
  Adding source evalchk.c for "solver" evalchk that sets suffix .numerr
on objectives and constraints to 0 if they can be evalated at the given
starting point, to 1 if not, and to 2 if the entity but not its gradient
can be evaluated.

20120216
  amplfunc.c, spamfunc.c: when there is no objective (n_obj == 0), have
	[f,c] = amplfunc(x,0)
and
	[f,c] = spamfunc(x,0)
return f = 0, and similarly have
	[g,J] = amplfunc(x,1)
and
	[g,J] = spamfunc(x,1)
return a vector of zeros for g.
  makefile.u: omit mention of spamfun4.c.
  hist.c:  behave better when the client program stops.
