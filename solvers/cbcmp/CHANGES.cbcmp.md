Summary of recent updates to CBCMP for AMPL
===========================================


## 20250308
- Changes in MP.


## 20250206
- Updated to CBC version 2.10.12


## 20241128
- Fixed a bug that made CBC segfault for some models


## 20241124
- Greatly improved model generation time by pushing all the model
  at once to CBC


## 20240724
- Option *acc:_all*
	- Useful to disable all reformulations (acc:_all=2),
		or force linearization (acc:_all=0).
- Option *cvt:prod*     
  - Controls reformulation of binary products into logical 
    constraints.
- Faster input of quadratic expressions.


## 20240617
- *Multi-objective emulator*
	- obj:multi=2 forces emulation, even if MO natively supported.
	- Fixed a bug in the objective degradation suffixes
		.objasbtol, .objreltol.


## 20240604
- Presolve division by constant, resulting in fewer constraints
- Fix no-solution case in multi-objective emulator


## 20240529
- *Multi-objective emulator*
	- All flat MP solvers support multi-objective mode (obj:multi=1),
		either natively, or via emulation.
	- Suffixes .objpriority, .objweight, .objabstol, .objreltol.
	- [BREAKING] Default intuitive handling of .objweight,
		see option obj:multi:weight, even when natively supported.


## 20240429
- [BREAKING] Merged `report_times` and `timing`; they 
  are now aliases, set the value to 1 to have basic info,
  to 2 to have more detailed info.


## 20240425
- Fixed reporting of feasible solutions if time limits
  are reached


## 20240320
- *SOS constraints*.
  - Fixed handling of SOS2 constraints created by AMPL
    as reformulations of PL expressions (`option
    pl_linearize 1`, default; set to 0 to use 
    MP linearization.)
  - Disallow repeated weights for SOS constraints
    (suffixes `.sosno`/`.ref`.)
- *Option `report_times`* 
- *Unused `acc:` options*.
  - The constraint acceptance options `acc:...`
    for non-handled constraints are ignored
    (previously triggered error.)


## 20240115
- *Solve result codes*.
  - List codes by running (solver) -!
  - [BREAKING] Standardized codes. Major changes:
    - 100-199 (solved?) means solution candidate
      provided, but can be suboptimal/infeasible
    - 300-349 means unbounded problem but
      feasible solution returned
    - 400-449 means limit/interrupt but feasible
  - [BREAKING] sol:chk:fail returns code 150 (solved?)
- Compact solution check warnings
- Fixed presolve of the power function #226.


## 20231117
- MP update: fixed graceful exit on Ctrl-C from AMPL in Linux
  and fixed issue with reading text-format NL files


## 20231103
- Improved translation of logical constraints:
  inlining of nested disjunctions and conjunctions;
  fewer auxiliary binary variables.


## 20231017
- Fixed a bug in NL reader on Windows.


## 20230919
- *mp_options*.
	Receive mp_options from AMPL (for all MP solvers).
	They are parsed before (solvername)_options.
- Solution checking: relative tolerance
	sol:chk:feastolrel; options sol:chk:round, sol:chk:prec.


## 20230907
- Updated to CBC library version 2.10.10


## 20230831
- Solution checking, options sol:chk:* (experimental).
- Preprocess And/Or constraints.


## 20230817
- Fixed a bug causing repeated names for
  auxiliary variables and constraints.
- Option values can be assigned without '='.
- Fixed a bug where equivalent conditional
  comparisons were not unified.


## 20230726
- Fixed inequalities of integer expressions with
  non-integer constants, see test_int_non_int.mod.


## 20230713
- Fixed how certain options are passed to the underlying CBC library

- Fixed returning of constraint duals


## 20230616
- Changes in MP.


## 20230424
- *Changes in the MP library*: added variable names support
  and removed spurious starting solution

  
## 20230207
- *Changes in the MP library*


## 20221228
- *Changes in the MP library*


## 20221222
- *Changes in the MP library*


## 20221211
- *Changes in MP: added the ==> else operator*
   Implemented implication with 'else': *constr1* ==> *constr2* [else *constr3*]   

- *Changes in MP: PLApproxRelTol, PLApproxDomain*
   Parameters to control piecewise-linear approximation.
   cvt:plapprox:reltol default value changed from 1e-5 to 0.01.


## 20221208
- First release of MP-based cbc driver
