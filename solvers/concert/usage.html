<h1>
Constraint Logic Programming Extensions Recognized by the Concert Driver
</h1>

        For combinatorial or discrete optimization, AMPL currently
provides the option of including integer-valued variables in algebraic
objectives and constraints.  This is sufficient to make good use of
integer programming solvers that use a classical branch-and-bound
procedure.<p>

        Optimization systems for <i>constraint logic programming</i>
also use a branching or tree search, but are able to work with a much
broader variety of combinatorial expressions.  In exchange for this
advantage, logic programming solvers typically forego the ability to
generate the bounds and cuts that are used to great advantage to limit
the search in integer programming.  The logic programming approach
thus tends to be advantageous for problems that are "highly"
combinatorial, in the sense that their formulation in terms of integer
variables is artificial and hard to work with, or requires a very
large number of variables or constraints, or fails to yield strong
bounds.</p><p>

        AMPL could be extended in a variety of ways to take better
advantage of the strengths of constraint logic programming solvers.
Several kinds of constraints useful in logic programming are naturally
expressed by allowing variables in certain operands or arguments where
only constant expressions are currently permitted.  The features of
constraint logic programming systems also suggest some operators and
functions that should be added to the AMPL language.  Possibilities 
include:

</p><ul>
<li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#logop">Logical operators</a>:</i></b> <tt>and</tt>,
<tt>or</tt>, <tt>not</tt>; iterated <tt>exists</tt>, <tt>forall</tt>

</li><li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#condop">Conditional operators</a>:</i></b>
<tt>if-then</tt>, <tt>if-then-else</tt>

</li><li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#cardop">Counting operators</a>:</i></b> iterated
<tt>count</tt>, <tt>atmost1</tt>, <tt>atmost(</tt><i>k</i><tt>)</tt>, 
etc.

</li><li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#pairop">Pairwise operators</a>:</i></b> 
<tt>alldiff</tt>, <tt>alldisjoint</tt>

</li><li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#varsub">Variables in subscripts</a>:</i></b>
expressions like <tt>X[S[j]]</tt>, <tt>SC[S[j-1],S[j]]</tt>, etc.
</li></ul>

Other extensions would permit a broader variety of expressions for
defining a variable's domain:

<ul>
<li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#objvar">Object-valued variables</a></i></b>

</li><li><b><i><a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/logic.html#setvar">Set-valued variables</a></i></b>
</li></ul>

Each of these items corresponds to a section below, in which we
motivate a new group of features and propose corresponding AMPL
language extensions.  A final paragraph or two in each section
indicates how the C++ classes and member functions provided by
<a href="http://www.ilog.com/">ILOG Solver</a> could be used to solve
problems that have been expressed using the proposed features.  (There
is a further possibility, which we do not pursue here, of defining new
classes and member functions to more efficiently handle certain AMPL
features.)

<h2>
<a name="logop">Logical operators</a>
</h2>
        Current AMPL constraints consist of numerical-valued
expressions connected by <tt>&lt; =</tt>, <tt>&gt; =</tt> or <tt&gt =<="" tt="">.  A
natural extension would be to allow these constraint expressions to be
connected by AMPL's unary and binary logical operators,

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><i>constraint-expr1</i><tt> or </tt><i>constraint-expr2</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff at least one of the operands is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd><dt><i>constraint-expr1</i><tt> and </tt><i>constraint-expr2</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff both of the operands are satisfied.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>not </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the operand is not satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

and AMPL's iterated forms of the binary logical operators:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>exists {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>} </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the operand is satisfied for at least one member
of the indexing set (the iterated form of <tt>or</tt>).<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>forall {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>} </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the operand is satisfied for all members
of the indexing set (the iterated form of <tt>and</tt>).<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

If we allow <i>constraint-expr</i> to be any valid expression for a
constraint, and permit grouping of constraint expressions by 
parentheses, 

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>(</tt> <i>constraint-expr</i> <tt>)</tt><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

then an AMPL constraint can be any logical combination of equalities
and inequalities.<p>

        The simplest useful application of this extension would be to
specify disjunctive constraints.  For example, in
<tt>multmip3.mod</tt> from the AMPL book, we require for every origin
<tt>i</tt> and destination <tt>j</tt> that total shipments
<tt>sum</tt> <tt>{p</tt> <tt>in</tt> <tt>PROD}</tt>
<tt>Trans[i,j,p]</tt> lie either at zero or between <tt>minload</tt>
and <tt>limit[i,j]</tt>.  This is accomplished in an integer
programming framework by introducing auxiliary binary variables
<tt>Use[i,j]</tt>,</p><p>
</p><pre>   var Trans {ORIG,DEST,PROD} &gt; = 0;
   var Use {ORIG,DEST} binary;
</pre>
and forming the following constraints:
<pre>   subject to Multi {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &lt; = limit[i,j] * Use[i,j];

   subject to Min_Ship {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt; = minload * Use[i,j];
</pre>
The same restrictions could be stated using the <tt>or</tt> operator
in this way:
<pre>   subject to Multi_Min_Ship {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] = 0 <b>or</b>
      minload &lt; = sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &lt; = limit[i,j];
</pre>
Fewer variables and constraints are required, and the statement of
the constraint is much closer to its original formulation.<p>

        In another example, variables <tt>Assign[i1,i2,j]</tt> have
been defined to represent the number of people of type
<tt>(i1,i2)</tt> assigned to location <tt>j</tt>.  The following
declarations define an additional restriction in integer programming
terms:</p><p>
</p><pre>   param upperbnd {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST} :=
      min (ceil((number2[i1,i2]/card {PEOPLE}) * hiDine[j]) + give[i1,i2],
           hiTargetTitle[i1,j] + giveTitle[i1],
           hiTargetLoc[i2,j] + giveLoc[i2],
           number2[i1,i2]);

   var Lone {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST} binary;

   subj to Isolation1 {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] &lt; = upperbnd[i1,i2,j] * Lone[i1,i2,j];

   subj to Isolation2a {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] +
         sum {ii1 in ADJACENT[i1]: (ii1,i2) in TYPE2} Assign2[ii1,i2,j]
            &gt; = 2 * Lone[i1,i2,j];

   subj to Isolation2b {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] &gt; = Lone[i1,i2,j];
</pre>
Using the <tt>or</tt> operator, the same thing can be said much more
directly and concisely:
<pre>   subj to Isolation {(i1,i2) in ISO, j in REST}:
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] = 0 <b>or</b>
      Assign2[i1,i2,j] +
         sum {ii1 in ADJACENT[i1]: 
                       (ii1,i2) in TYPE2} Assign2[ii1,i2,j] &gt; = 2;
</pre>
As a further complication under the integer programming approach,
there are many other ways that this either-or constraint can be
transformed, through addition of binary variables, to inequalities
suitable for integer programming.  Other transformations differ in the
computation of the upper bound parameter, in the details of the
constraint expressions, and in the choice of "cuts" such as
<tt>Isolation2b</tt> to tighten the formulation.  The transformation
exhibited above is not obviously superior to others, though it did
prove to be superior -- for the data of interest -- in a series of
empirical tests.<p>

        Although the use of <tt>or</tt> could be limited to simple
cases like this, it would be desirable to allow the full generality of
logical operations on constraint equalities and inequalities.  There
are thorny issues to be dealt with in the general case, however:

</p><ul>
<li>If <tt>not</tt> is permitted, it is possible to specify a 
    feasible region that isn't closed.  As a result, optimization
    problems using continuous variables may be meaningless.  This
    is illustrated by a very simple problem:
<pre>        minimize Obj: x;
        subject to OpenCons: not (x &lt; = 2);
</pre>
    The objective has an infimum of 2, but no minimum that
    satisfies the constraint.  (The same problem arises if we
    allow &lt;  and &gt;  in the constraints.)<p>

</p></li><li>The arguments to a disjuctive constraint tend to have
    similarities, which may need to be taken into account in order
    to deal with the constraint most efficiently.  It may be 
    important for solvers to know, for example, that the constraint
    <tt>Multi_Min_Ship</tt> above is a zero-or-range constraint
    on the common expression <tt>sum</tt> <tt>{p</tt> <tt>in</tt> 
    <tt>PROD}</tt> <tt>Trans[i,j,p]</tt>.<p>
</p></li></ul>

Solver drivers would have to detect and deal with these situations by
analyzing the expression tree that they receive from AMPL.  There are
ways that AMPL could help,however, such as by identifying common
subexpressions and by flagging certain common special cases.<p>

        <b>ILOG Solver</b> provides analogues for AMPL's <tt>and</tt>
(<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>), <tt>or</tt> (<tt>||</tt>), and <tt>not</tt>
(<tt>!</tt>) by overloading existing C++ operators.  It also defines
operators for exclusive or (<tt>!=</tt>), equivalence (<tt&gt =="&lt;/tt">),
and implication (<tt>&lt; =</tt>).  The effect of AMPL's iterated logical
operators can be achieved by using its <tt>IlcCard</tt> function to 
count the number of instances of a <i>constraint-expr</i> that are
true; see also the discussion of counting operators below.</tt&gt></p>

<h2>
<a name="condop">Conditional operators</a>
</h2>
        AMPL already provides an <tt>if-then-else</tt> operator that
returns a value that can be used in expressions:<p>

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>
      then </tt><i>object-expr1</i>
</dt><dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>
      then </tt><i>object-expr1</i><tt> 
      else </tt><i>object-expr2</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Takes the value of <i>object-expr1</i> when the
<i>logical-expr</i> is true, and the value of <i>object-expr2</i> (or
0 if omitted) when the <i>logical-expr</i> is false.  Each
<i>object-expr</i> may be any expression that evaluates to a legal set
member -- that is, either a number or a string.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt>
      then </tt><i>set-expr1</i><tt>
      else </tt><i>set-expr2</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Takes the value of <i>set-expr1</i> when the <i>logical-expr</i>
is true, and the value of <i>set-expr2</i> when the
<i>logical-expr</i> is false.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

When this operator appears in a constraint, the <i>logical-expr</i>
can contain variables, in which case AMPL handles the constraint like
other nonlinear constraints, passing an expression tree to the solver.
In particular, the <i>logical-expr</i> may be any valid
<i>constraint-expr</i>.<p>

AMPL also has a similar <tt>if-then</tt> form of indexing expression,
which is used in the context of constraints as follows:

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>subject to {if </tt><i>const-logical-expr</i><tt>}:
      </tt><i>constraint-expr</i><tt>;</tt><p>

</p></dt><dd>Enforces the constraint specified by the <i>constraint-expr</i> 
if and only if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Thus for example in section 8.4 of the book we have:
<pre>   subject to Time {if avail &gt;  0}:
      sum {p in PROD} (1/rate[p]) * Make[p] &lt; = avail;
</pre>
It is arguably more natural, howver, to make the <tt>if</tt> condition
part of the constraint expression:
<pre>   subject to Time:
      if avail &gt;  0 then
         sum {p in PROD} (1/rate[p]) * Make[p] &lt; = avail;
</pre>
By allowing variables in the <i>logical-expr</i> following <tt>if</tt>,
we arrive at another appealing form of constraint for logic programming:
<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt> then
      </tt><i>constraint-expr1</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true and
<i>constraint-expr1</i> is satisfied, or if the <i>logical-expr</i> is
false.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>if </tt><i>logical-expr</i><tt> then
      </tt><i>constraint-expr1</i><tt> else
      </tt><i>constraint-expr2</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied if the <i>logical-expr</i> is true and
<i>constraint-expr1</i> is satisfied, or if the <i>logical-expr</i> is
false and <i>constraint-expr2</i> is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

By allowing variables following <tt>if</tt>, these forms would
considerably expand the variety of conditional constraints that AMPL
could conveniently express.  For example, the previously defined
<tt>Multi_Min_Ship</tt> constraint could be written:
<pre>   subject to Multi_Min_Ship {i in ORIG, j in DEST}:
      if sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt;  0 then
         minload &lt; = sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &lt; = limit[i,j];
</pre>
Again, the <i>logical-expr</i> could be any <i>constraint-expr</i>.
<p>

<b>ILOG Solver</b> can directly define if-then constraints like
<tt>Time</tt> and <tt>Multi_Min_Ship</tt> above by use of either a
constraint-posting function (<tt>IlcIfThen</tt>) or an implication
operator (<tt>&lt; =</tt>).  There is no direct support for
if-then-<i>else</i> constraints, however; they have to be built from
two calls to <tt>IlcIfThen</tt> or an equivalent constraint expression
using several logical operators.</p><p>

AMPL's if-then and if-then-else operators, described at the beginning
of this section, have a direct analogue as a C++ operator, but C++
does not allow the overloading of that operator that would be
necessary to permit its use with Solver's constraint data types.</p>

<h2>
<a name="cardop">Counting operators</a>
</h2>
        AMPL's <tt>card</tt> operator returns the number of members in
a set.  When it is applied to a set defined in terms of variables, it
can count the number of constraints of a given form that are
satisfied.  For instance, in the <tt>multmip3.mod</tt> example
previously cited, there is the following constraint on the number of
destinations served by any origin:
<pre>   subject to Max_Serve {i in ORIG}:
      sum {j in DEST} Use[i,j] &lt; = maxserve;
</pre>
Using <tt>card</tt>, the same thing could be expressed in terms of
the natural <tt>Trans[i,j,p]</tt> variables, without recourse to the
auxiliary zero-one <tt>Use[i,j]</tt> variables:
<pre>   subject to Max_Serve {i in ORIG}:
      card {j in DEST: sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt;  0} &lt; = maxserve;
</pre>
This form might be too general, however.  The operand of <tt>card</tt>
could be any set expression.  To implement the resulting constraint,
the solver would have to receive enough information to enable it to
evaluate that set expression given any values of the variables.  We
could circumvent this difficulty by restricting the ways in which
variables may appear in the argument to <tt>card</tt>, but we prefer
to avoid complicating the language design with such restrictions.
Instead, we could define a new operator that explicitly counts the
number of times that a certain constraint is satisfied:<p>

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>count {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>The number of members of the <i>indexing</i> set such that the 
<i>constraint-expr</i> is satisfied.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

The above constraint would then be written:
<pre>   subject to Max_Serve {i in ORIG}:
      count {j in DEST} (sum {p in PROD} Trans[i,j,p] &gt;  0) &lt; = maxserve;
</pre>
The <i>constraint-expr</i> could be any valid AMPL constraint.  The
AMPL translator would instantiate it for each member of the
<i>indexing</i> set, and would communicate all of the instantiated
constraints to the solver using the conventions already in place.<p>

Additional iterated logical operators might be defined to simplify 
the descriptions of constraints in some common special cases:

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>atmost1 {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for at most
one member of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>atleast1 {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for at least
one member of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>exactly1 {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for exactly
one member of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

The <tt>atleast1</tt> operator is a synonym for <tt>exists</tt>, but
the other two are not currently available in AMPL.  A further
generalization would replace the <tt>1</tt> in these operators by a
parenthesized number:<p>

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>atmost(</tt><i>k</i><tt>) {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i>
</dt><dt><tt>atleast(</tt><i>k</i><tt>) {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i>
</dt><dt><tt>exactly(</tt><i>k</i><tt>) {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>constraint-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>constraint-expr</i> holds for at most (at
least, exactly) <i>k</i> members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

We could restrict <i>k</i> to a positive integer constant, but in
principle it could be any constant arithmetic expression that
evaluates to a positive (or perhaps nonnegative) integer value.<p>

Another particularly important special case occurs when counting the
number of set members at which a given expression takes a particular
value.  As a simple example, consider the scheduling problem that
assigns a number of jobs to a smaller number of machines, so that at
most <tt>cap[k]</tt> jobs are assigned to machine <tt>k</tt>.  The
conventional formulation defines a binary (zero-one) variable
<tt>Assign[j,k]</tt> for each job-machine pair, such that
<tt>Assign[j,k]</tt> will be 1 if and only if job <tt>j</tt> is
assigned to machine <tt>k</tt> (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/sched1.mod"><tt>sched1.mod</tt></a>):
</p><pre>   param n integer &gt;  0;

   set JOBS := 1..n;
   set MACHINES := 1..n;

   param cap {MACHINES} integer &gt; = 0;

   var Assign {JOBS,MACHINES} binary;
</pre>
The requirements of the assignment can then be specified by one
algebraic constraint for each job and for each machine:<p>
</p><pre>   subj to OneMachinePerJob {j in JOBS}:
      sum {k in MACHINES} Assign[j,k] = 1;

   subj to CapacityOfMachine {k in MACHINES}:
      sum {j in JOBS} Assign[j,k] &lt; = cap[k];
</pre>
As an alternative, we could associate with each job only one variable,
whose value is taken from the set of machines:
<pre>   var MachineForJob {JOBS} integer &gt; = 1, &lt; = n;
</pre>
For each <tt>j</tt> in <tt>JOBS</tt>, the value of
<tt>MachineForJob[j]</tt> would be the number of the machine that is
assigned to do job <tt>j</tt>.  This approach requires fewer variables
by an order of magnitude, and automatically enforces the requirement
that one machine be assigned to each job.  To specify that at most
<tt>cap[k]</tt> jobs are assigned to machine <tt>k</tt>, we could use
the proposed <tt>count</tt> operator (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/sched2.mod"><tt>sched2.mod</tt></a>):
<pre>   subj to CapacityOfMachine {k in MACHINES}:
      count {j in JOBS} (MachineForJob[j] = k) &lt; = cap[k];
</pre>
This is not as readable a statement of the constraint as one might
like, however, and it is likely to be inefficient.  Because the
<tt>count</tt> operator can be applied to any AMPL
<i>constraint-expr</i>, its implementation in the AMPL translator
would scan through the entire set <tt>JOBS</tt> for each constraint,
testing <tt>MachineForJob[j]</tt> <tt&gt =<="" tt=""> <tt>k</tt> for every
combination of job <tt>j</tt> and machine <tt>k</tt> -- even though
only one pass through the jobs is necessary to accumulate the counts
for all machines.  These circustances suggest that AMPL should instead
offer a more specialized iterated operator for counting individual
values assumed by an indexed expression (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/sched3.mod"><tt>sched3.mod</tt></a>):<p>
</p><pre>   subj to CapacityOfMachine {k in MACHINES}:
      countof(k) {j in JOBS} MachineForJob[j] &lt; = cap[k];
</pre>
The general form would be:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>countof(</tt><i>k</i><tt>) {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>object-expr</i> <p>

</p></dt><dd>The number of members of the <i>indexing</i> set such that the 
<i>object-expr</i> is equal to <i>k</i>.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Although it would still be possible to implement this operator
inefficiently, the presence of <tt>countof</tt> could alert the
AMPL translator to the possibility of a more efficient evaluation.<p>

<b>ILOG Solver</b>'s analogue to AMPL's cardinality operators is the
<tt>IlcCard</tt> function.  <tt>IlcCard</tt> acts like <tt>card</tt>
when called with one argument representing a set of integers (type
<tt>IlcIntSetVar</tt>) or objects (type <tt>IlcAnySetVar</tt>).  It
acts like <tt>count</tt> when called with an index (type
<tt>IlcIndex</tt>) and a constraint using that index (type
<tt>IlcConstraint</tt>).  The special case of the
<tt>countof(</tt><i>k</i><tt>)</tt> operator is implemented
efficiently through Solver's <tt>IlcDistribute</tt> function.</p><p>

In the case where <tt>IlcCard</tt> is called with two arguments, an
index is implicitly defined to run over the elements of one or more
arrays of integers (type <tt>IlcIntVarArray</tt>) or objects (type
<tt>IlcAnyVarArray</tt>).  To get the effect of AMPL's <tt>count</tt>
applied to an arbitrary indexed collection of constraints, Solver must
introduce auxiliary binary variables via its <i>metaconstraint</i>
feature.  The association between constraints and these binary
variables is maintained automatically, however, in contrast to the
integer programming approach where it is necessary to form additional
constraints (such as <tt>Multi</tt> and <tt>Min_Ship</tt> above) to
enforce the definition of the binary variables.</p>

<h2>
<a name="pairop">Pairwise operators</a>
</h2>
        Various assignment and related combinatorial problems require
that a collection of entities be pairwise different or disjoint.  New
iterated operators for these conditions would make them easier to
state and would help to make the resulting problems easier to
solve.<p>

An example is given by the assignment problem that resembles the one
defined above, but with equal numbers of jobs and machines.  Each
job is assigned to one machine, as before, but also each machine gets
one job.  In describing the constraints on the machines, we can
dispense with the parameters <tt>cap[k]</tt> (which would all be 1)
and can instead simply say that no two variables
<tt>MachineForJob[j1]</tt> and <tt>MachineForJob[j2]</tt> have the
same value.  Such a restriction can be stated in AMPL as follows:
</p><pre>   subj to OneJobPerMachine {j1 in JOBS, j2 in JOBS: j1 &lt;  j2}:
      MachineForJob[j1] != MachineForJob[j2];
</pre>
This is a cumbersome way to express the simple idea of being pairwise
different, however, and it gives rise to an order of magnitude more
constraints than the conventional formulation (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/assign1.mod"><tt>assign1.mod</tt></a>).  We would prefer to
regard pairwise inequality as a property of the entire collection of
<tt>MachineForJob</tt> variables, rather than as a collection of
binary relations between individual variables.<p>

In AMPL, properties of indexed collections are defined by means of
iterated operators such as <tt>sum</tt> and <tt>exists</tt>.  Thus it
would make sense to introduce an analogous operator for pairwise
difference in an indexed collection of variables 
(<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/assign2.mod"><tt>assign2.mod</tt></a>):
</p><pre>   subj to OneJobPerMachine: alldiff {j in JOBS} MachineForJob[j];
</pre>
In general, this operator could be applied to any collection of 
expressions:

<dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>alldiff {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>object-expr</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>object-expr</i> takes different values for
all pairs of different members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

Using <tt>alldiff</tt> makes constraints easier to read, and also
conveys more useful information to a solver than a large collection of
individual inequalities.<p>

A similar operator could be introduced for indexed collections of
set expressions, to express the property of being pairwise disjoint:

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>alldisjoint {</tt><i>indexing</i><tt>}
    </tt><i>set-expr</i><p>

</p></dt><dd>Satisfied iff the <i>set-expr</i> evaluates to nonintersecting sets
for all pairs of different members of the <i>indexing</i> set.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

To express the same thing in current AMPL, it is necessary to state
for each pair of sets that their intersection has cardinality zero.<p>

<b>ILOG Solver</b> provides functions that correspond closely to these
iterated pairwise operators.  Function <tt>IlcAllDiff</tt> specifies
that the components of an array of integers (type
<tt>IlcIntVarArray</tt>) or an array of objects (type
<tt>IlcAnyVarArray</tt>) must be pairwise different.  Function
<tt>IlcAllNullIntersect</tt> specifies that the components of an array
of integer sets (type <tt>IlcIntSetVarArray</tt>) or an array of
object sets (type <tt>IlcAnySetVarArray</tt>) must be pairwise
disjoint.  Solver's search procedure handles these relationships
directly in an efficient way.</p>

<h2>
<a name="varsub">Variables in subscripts</a>
</h2>
        When we use zero-one variables for the assignment model, it
is easy to express the objective as a conventional linear programming
expression:
<pre>   minimize TotalCost:
      sum {j in JOBS, k in MACHINES} cost[j,k] * Assign[j,k];
</pre>
To use the <tt>MachineForJob</tt> variables, however, we are
currently forced to resort to a more awkward formulation:
<pre>   minimize TotalCost:
      sum {j in JOBS, k in MACHINES} 
         if MachineForJob[j] = k then cost[j,k];
</pre>
If we could simply write the cost of assigning machine <tt>j</tt> to
job <tt>MachineForJob[j]</tt> as <tt>cost[j,MachineForJob[j]]</tt>,
then the objective could be expressed much more naturally (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/assign3.mod"><tt>assign3.mod</tt></a>):
<pre>   minimize TotalCost:
      sum {j in JOBS, k in MACHINES} cost[j,MachineForJob[j]];
</pre>
This would require an extension to AMPL, since currently variables are
not allowed to appear in subscripts in the objective of a model.<p>

There is also good reason to want to use variables within subscripts
in the constraints, as may be seen by considering the related problem
of sequencing.  In a representative sequencing problem, we may want to
assign a number of jobs to an equal number of "slots" so that each job
is assigned to a different slot.  The key difference between these
slots and the machines of the assignment example is that the slots
have a significant ordering.  Setup costs and times between jobs are a
function of this slot ordering, in ways that can be hard to express
using current AMPL features.</p><p>

To illustrate the difficulties and a prospective remedy, we define 
data for a simple sequencing problem as follows:
</p><pre>   param n integer &gt;  0;

   set JOBS := 1..n;
   set SLOTS := 1..n;

   param procTime {JOBS} &gt;  0;
   param dueTime {JOBS} &gt;  0;
   param duePenalty {JOBS} &gt;  0;

   set JOBPAIRS := {j1 in JOBS, j2 in JOBS: j1 != j2};
   set PREC within JOBPAIRS;

   param setupCost {JOBPAIRS} &gt; = 0;
   param setupTime {JOBPAIRS} &gt; = 0;
</pre>
For each job <tt>j</tt>, <tt>procTime[j]</tt> is the processing time
required for the job, <tt>dueTime[j]</tt> is the deadline for
completion of the job, and <tt>duePenalty[j]</tt> is a cost per unit
of time that the job is finished early.  For each pair of jobs
<tt>j1</tt> and <tt>j2</tt>, <tt>(j1,j2)</tt> is in the set
<tt>PREC</tt> if and only if <tt>j1</tt> must be finished before
<tt>j2</tt>; <tt>setupCost[j1,j2]</tt> and <tt>setupTime[j1,j2]</tt>
are the cost and time required to set up for job <tt>j2</tt>, if it is
assigned to the slot immediately following job <tt>j1</tt>'s slot.<p>

Adopting the approach introduced in the assignment example, we could
define the variables as follows:
</p><pre>   var SlotForJob {JOBS} integer &gt; = 1, &lt; = n;
   var JobForSlot {SLOTS} integer &gt; = 1, &lt; = n;

   var FinishTime {{0} union JOBS};
</pre>
<tt>SlotForJob[j]</tt> is the slot assigned to job <tt>j</tt>, and
conversely <tt>JobForSlot[k]</tt> is the job assigned to slot
<tt>k</tt>.  <tt>FinishTime[j]</tt> is the time that job <tt>j</tt> is
finished, with <tt>FinishTime[0]</tt> being the same as the start
time.  The number of variables remains proportional to the number of
jobs, but we must figure out how to express the objective and
constraints in terms of these variables.<p>

What is the setup cost associated with the <tt>k</tt>th slot?  It is
the cost of going from <tt>JobForSlot[k-1]</tt> to
<tt>JobForSlot[k]</tt>, or
</p><pre>   setupCost[JobForSlot[k-1],JobForSlot[k]]
</pre>
This is not currently a valid AMPL expression, because it uses
variables as subscripts to a parameter.  It is certainly a very
natural expression for this kind of problem, however, when the
variables are defined in the efficient way we have given.  The setup
times are represented by an analogous expression.  The completion time
of the job in the <tt>k</tt>th slot is given by the expression
<pre>   FinishTime[JobForSlot[k]]
</pre>
which illustrates that it is equally natural to subscript a variable
with another variable.  Using these expressions, we can write the
lower limit for the completion time of the job in the <tt>k</tt>th
slot as the following constraint:
<pre>   FinishTime[JobForSlot[k-1]] 
      + setupTime[JobForSlot[k-1],JobForSlot[k]]
      + procTime[JobForSlot[k]] 
           &lt; = FinishTime[JobForSlot[k]]
</pre>
The <tt>SlotForJob</tt> variables are needed for the precedence
constraints; for each pair of jobs <tt>(j1,j2)</tt> in set
<tt>PREC</tt>,
<pre>   SlotForJob[j1] &lt;  SlotForJob[j2]
</pre>
Finally, to ensure that the <tt>JobForSlot</tt> and
<tt>SlotForJob</tt> variables describe the same valid sequencing, we
need one more instance of a variable subscripted by a variable; for
each job <tt>j</tt>,
<pre>   JobForSlot[SlotForJob[j]] = j
</pre>
This constraint also indirectly ensures that each job is assigned a
different slot, and each slot is assigned a different job.  In the
complete model (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/seq1.mod"><tt>seq1.mod</tt></a>) the
number of constraints is only on the order of the number of jobs
(unless there is a huge number of precedence relations).<p>

In general, any subscript in a constraint might be an expression that
contains variables.  Unlike current AMPL subscripts, these could not
simply be instantiated when AMPL generates constraints.  Rather, for
each such subscript, AMPL would have to provide the solver with
instructions for evaluating the expression, in the form of an
expression tree or (for linear expressions) a list of coefficients.</p><p>

<b>ILOG Solver</b>'s arrays of integers (type <tt>IlcIntArray</tt>)
and integer variables (type <tt>IlcIntVarArray</tt>) have a
subscripting operator that admits any integer expression (type
<tt>IlcIntExp</tt>) as its argument.  Since an integer expression may
in general contain variables, subscripts containing variables could be
implemented straightforwardly.  This observation also extends to
Solver's analogous arrays of floating-point numbers (types
<tt>IlcFloatArray</tt>, <tt>IlcFloatVarArray</tt>) and of objects
(types <tt>IlcAnyArray</tt>, <tt>IlcAnyVarArray</tt>).</p>

<h2>
<a name="objvar">Object-valued variables</a>
</h2>
        Currently a <tt>var</tt> declaration can use only the
<tt>&gt; =</tt> and <tt>&lt; =</tt> operators to restrict the domain of a
variable.  If the <tt>in</tt> operator were also allowed in this
context, then variables could be restricted to taking values from a
given set:<p>

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>var </tt><i>indexing<sub><font size="-2">opt</font></sub></i><tt>
    </tt><i>var-name</i><tt> in </tt><i>const-set-expr</i><tt> ;</tt> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Restricts the defined variable(s) to values that lie within the set
specified by the <i>const-set-expr</i>.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

In the context of logic programming, the interesting case is where the
<i>const-set-expr</i> specifies a set of objects denoted by character
strings (or arbitrary numbers).  The case where this expression is a
union of significant numerical values and/or intervals is naturally
handled in the more traditional context of numerical-valued variables
and integer programming, <i>as will be explained elsewhere . . .</i><p>

As an example, in the preceding assignment model we artificially
defined <tt>JOBS</tt> and <tt>MACHINES</tt> to be sets of the first
<tt>n</tt> integers.  If object-valued variables were allowed,
however, these could be modeled as sets of objects to be read from the
problem data, with a check that each contained the same number of
objects:
</p><pre>   set JOBS;
   set MACHINES;
      check card (JOBS) = card (MACHINES);
</pre>
For each <tt>j</tt> in <tt>JOBS</tt>, the variable
<tt>MachineForJob[j]</tt> would then have as its value the member of
set <tt>MACHINES</tt> that is assigned to do job <tt>j</tt>.  Hence it
would be declared as an object-valued variable:
<pre>   var MachineForJob {JOBS} in MACHINES; 
</pre> 
The remainder of the formulation (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/assign4.mod"><tt>assign4.mod</tt></a>) would be the same as
before.  A similarly minor change to our sequencing model (<a href="http://www.ampl.com/NEW/FUTURE/LOGIC/seq2.mod"><tt>seq2.mod</tt></a>) would permit it also to use
a set of objects for the jobs.<p>

<b>ILOG Solver</b> provides <i>constrained enumerated variables</i>
(types <tt>IlcAnyVar</tt> and <tt>IlcAnyVarArray</tt>) whose values
may be arbitrary objects.  Solver's integer-valued variables can also
be used in contexts where each integer stands for an object (rather
than for a numerical value that participates in arithmetic
expressions).  The <tt>IlcAllDiff</tt> operator required for our
formulation is applicable to both object and integer arrays.</p>

<h2>
<a name="setvar">Set-valued variables</a>
</h2>
        Many kinds of combinatorial problems are more naturally
described in terms of choosing an optimal subset, than in terms of any
numerical decision variables.  Thus a second extension to the
<tt>var</tt> declaration's domain specification would give rise to
variables that take subsets as values.<p>

As an example, consider first a simple knapsack problem that concerns
a set of objects having given values and weights, and an overall
capacity:
</p><pre>   set OBJECTS;

   param value {OBJECTS} &gt;  0;
   param weight {OBJECTS} &gt;  0;

   param capacity &gt;  0;
</pre>
The problem can be stated concisely and naturally as follows:  find a
subset of some given set of objects, such that the total value of the
subset is maximized, subject to the total weight of the subset being
less than the capacity.  This statement can be converted to a
conventional algebraic formulation, by defining binary variable
corresponding to each object:
<pre>   var In {OBJECTS} binary;

   maximize Total_Value: 
      sum {i in OBJECTS} value[i] * In[i];

   subject to Weight_Limit:
      sum {i in OBJECTS} weight[i] * In[i] &lt; = capacity;
</pre>
The concise and natural original description could be expressed
directly in AMPL, however, by use of a set-valued variable:
<pre>   var Knapsack within OBJECTS;

   maximize Total_Value: 
      sum {i in Knapsack} value[i];

   subject to Weight_Limit:
      sum {i in Knapsack} weight[i] &lt; = capacity;
</pre>
The alternative objective and constraint superficially resemble the
standard algebraic constraints, but they sum over the members of the
set-valued variable <tt>Knapsack</tt> rather than over the given set
<tt>OBJECTS</tt>.<p>

The budgeted traveling salesman problem offers a somewhat different
example.  The problem is stated in terms of a set of cities, one
designated the home city; a set of city pairs on which travel is
possible, and travel costs between these pairs; and an overall budget:
</p><pre>   set CITIES; 
   param Home symbolic in CITIES; 

   set LINKS within {i in CITIES, j in CITIES: i &lt; &gt;  j}; 
   param cost {LINKS}; 

   param budget &gt;  0;
</pre>
In one version of the problem, the goal is to plan a tour from the
home city visiting as many cities as possible, using only available
city-pair links, and subject to the total travel cost being within the
budget.  For this case we need a variable whose values are
(circularly) ordered subsets of cities:
<pre>   var Tour circular within CITIES; 

   maximize Cities_Visited: card {Tour}; 

   subject to Budget_Limit: 
      sum {c in Tour} cost[c,next(c)] &lt; = budget; 

   subject to Leave_Home: first(Tour) = Home; 

   subject to Link_Exists {c in Tour}: (c,next(c)) in LINKS;
</pre>
Unlike the knapsack problem, this one has no especially obvious
equivalent as an integer program.  The equivalent IPs that do exist,
moreover, are generally too hard for general-purpose integer
programming codes except in very small instances.  Most combinatorial
optimization problems of practical complexity share these
characteristics.<p>

   The general forms for declarations of set-valued variables
would be as follows:

</p><dl><blockquote>

<dt><tt>var </tt><i>indexing<sub><font size="-2">opt</font></sub></i><tt>
    </tt><i>var-name</i><tt> within 
    </tt><i>const-set-expr</i><tt> ;</tt> <p>

</p></dt><dd>Defines set-valued variables whose domain consists of all unordered
subsets of the set specified by the <i>const-set-expr</i>.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>var </tt><i>indexing<sub><font size="-2">opt</font></sub></i><tt>
    </tt><i>var-name</i><tt> ordered within 
    </tt><i>const-set-expr</i><tt> ;</tt> <p>

</p></dt><dd>The same as above, except the <i>const-set-expr</i> must describe
an ordered set, and induces an ordering on all of the subsets in the
variable's domain.  Ordered set functions such as <tt>first</tt> and
<tt>next</tt> may thus be applied to the variable and its members.<p>

</p></dd><dt><tt>var </tt><i>indexing<sub><font size="-2">opt</font></sub></i><tt>
    </tt><i>var-name</i><tt> circular within 
    </tt><i>const-set-expr</i><tt> ;</tt> <p>

</p></dt><dd>The same as above, except the orderings are circular.<p>

</p></dd></blockquote></dl>

The use of <tt>within</tt> in the domain specification is sufficient
to distinguish declarations of set-valued variables.  The distinction
could be emphasized, however, by starting the declaration with a new
keyword (such as <tt>var_set</tt>) or an extra keyword (as in
<tt>var</tt> <tt>set</tt>).<p>
