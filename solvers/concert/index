AMPL INTERFACE TO ILOG SOLVER

concert.cpp -- 
   driver main program using ILOG's Concert library

build_expr.cpp --
   input is an ASL expr* for a numerical-valued expression
   output is an equivalent IloExpr for the expression

build_constr.cpp --
   input is an ASL expr* for a logical-valued expression
      (for instance an "or" node, "<=" node, or "alldiff" node)
   output is an equivalent IloConstraint for the expression

build_numberof.cpp --
   build_numberof makes a list of all seen "numberof" operators
      having constant first operand
   finish_building_numberof runs after constraint processing, to 
      combine "numberof" operators into IloDistribute constraints 
      (which are much more useful to the solution procedure)


A few options have been implemented -- see OPTION-KEY for details.
More options for built-in search strategies will be needed.  Also
some sort of variable preference mechanism is likely to be useful.
